# OpenCV_HW
Using OpenCV in python and Cpp for the image based operations
we can use "Mat(nrows, ncols, type[, fillValue])" constructor. It stores the numbers by row by row.
example:- 
Although CVmat is replaced by mat in new versions.
A program reads the cvMat object from rows to column to type. In type we can specify the type of pixels. typically by specifying channels. The order of the pixel structure is bit depth (number of values can be held), models of color spaces, and number of channels.
